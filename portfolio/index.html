<h2>Final Reflection</h2>
  <p>Throughout the term, Composing Digital Media has pushed my proficiency in multiple mediums. Specifically, I learned the most about HTML and CSS since I had the most room to grow here, as I came in with no prior knowledge. Although I focused on Audacity during my skills assignment, I found this to be less beneficial because of the way that I chose to approach this. Since I entered the class with a high degree of knowledge in Photoshop as I use this at my job every day, I put less focus on trying to improve this because I felt that it would not be as worthwhile. Essentially, my main goal was just to put in effort and test out new ideas, because it is in the trying that I feel I learn the most.<br><br>
Because HTML and CSS was my main source of focus, I took an open approach to the class in its entirety because I knew this main aspect would not work as I planned. The course has served not only to enhance my understanding of how we introduce content to the digital world, but also to draw my attention to the revision process from beginning to end. Accordingly, the four principles of digital production as established in the Lo-fi Manifesto strongly guided me throughout. While I engaged with the learning and openness principles, the principles of flexibility and iteration were more impactful for me.<br><br> 
Flexibility encompasses “imaginative problem-solving”, which I continuously practiced. This applied not only to coding, when ideas that I intended such as parallax navigation could not be executed so I had to develop a different design that would still convey the easy vibe that is inherent in guided scrolling, but also to a variety of classwork assignments. For example, in creating the soundscape, Audacity did not perform the functions that I was expecting, so I had to problem-solve with the resources I had to achieve the same goal of creating the experience of being inside a bottle of beer.<br><br>  
Iteration was notably the most impactful principle that guided my work. I have always struggled with the idea of investing a lot of time into a draft of something only to have to scrap this work because of “how far short it falls of the idea that originally inspired it.” Even with a background in studio arts, I struggle with this because I form an emotional attachment to the time that I spent on a project rather than the project itself. Keeping this principle in mind was key in enabling me to develop my website as fluidly across the semester as I did. Along these lines, I also embraced accidents that I made, such as the text color changing on the main navigation when these pages were active, or in some of the dialogue that I included in my storyboard.<br><br>
These approaches to the revision process enabled me to achieve the initial goal that I had, which was a feeling of fun, simplicity, ease, and approachability. While my actual audience was my peers in the class, these goals were driven by my imagined audience. If someone from a small design firm with a laid-back office culture (career aspiration) was to come across my content, I would want to seem like a clear fit for their office. Importantly, I aimed to utilize a conversational voice throughout all work to show a bit of my personality (fun but still organized, with a little bit of surprise). I believe that I set this tone beginning with my About Me blurb, and I continued it in my other work, such as in my vintage advertisement that I brought into Photoshop by using humor that was straightforward, clever, and current with pop culture. I feel that the products that I have ended up with are reflective of the interplay between my content and process. Much of my process involved flexibility, adaptation to different challenges, and a positive outlook. I believe that these are evident in the final tone that much of my work has.<br><br>
Working with Audacity, Photoshop, HTML, and CSS, I found it was important to think about what all of these mediums would be able to provide before jumping in with something that did not make sense to try and achieve within these programs. I discovered this the hard way during my skills assignment with Audacity, learning that multimodality and modal considerations are actually incredibly important. It is both inefficient and frustrating when trying to use different digital mediums for purposes for which they were not designed. I think I succeeded in taking these into account when it came to the Photoshop assignments, along with in my website design. It was important to take into account the implications that exist in creating a website; that there is content you have that is shareable and, for one purpose or another, should be seen by anybody who wants to (or maybe does not even want to) access it.<br><br> 
Because of this, I was extra attentive to how I designed my site. I did not want it to feel too basic, too underwhelming, or too commercial. Multimodality is this concept that everything carries meaning, including where image is used or how content is organized. Novelty and creativity are very important to me, so I knew that I needed to incorporate elements that would provide this in my website design. That, along with the desire for a more streamlined looking site, led me to design my navigational functions to be based on abstracted images. I like this idea because it takes a bit of exploration and engagement to discover that these have more of a function than being just basic thumbnail images. I believe that this brings my audience to feel like they are more immersed in the website, which only serves to further the feeling of conversation that I am striving toward. Furthermore, the layout (both visually and regarding the organization of my content) that I chose to implement offers a bit of a surprise because things are not necessarily in the expected location, such as my menu bar.<br><br> 
	Overall, I think that this course encouraged me to be experimental with my concepts and fostered a sense of playfulness and humor in my content. I discovered the importance of considering my audience throughout my process, and think about the implications of different genres.
