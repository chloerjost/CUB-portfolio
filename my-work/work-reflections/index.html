  <h3>Reflections on Revisions</h3>
  <p> 1. An example of how I made a choice related to genre or audience:<br>
When using Photoshop to make the vintage advertisement become something novel, I knew for the first rendition that I wanted to use humor. I thought that a universal reference would be the most effective, as opposed to making a highly specific joke. Because of this, I chose to reference ‘basic girls’ who liked Starbucks drinks since this is such a popular concept, and play up the simplicity and the silliness of this. Throughout the semester, I noticed that some members of the class had a darker or more politically driven sense of humor, so I played with this when I chose to edit my second rendition. I decided to make a dishwashing liquid advertisement into a bleach skincare ad because I thought that the woman in it looked just miserable enough, that this would make a statement about how insane practices like tanning (which change the color of our skin) are, and to get the class to think about how we recognize that this is satirically comedy but how it might not have been in the time of the ad.<br><br>
2. An example of how I made a choice related to color, fonts, captions, scale, or other aspects of the visual mode:<br>
    In redesigning a logo for a company that is now-defunct in order to help them make a comeback in the 21st century, visual impact was the clear target of this assignment. For Pan Am, I thought that targeting a younger audience might be the best idea since we tend to travel for work and vacation so much. Accordingly, I wanted to create a design that was clean, recognizable, and light. I referenced Pan Am’s old designs, and in doing so this gave me the bright blue color against the white, and I chose to introduce the black to give a third color to contrast with. I chose the font I did because it was really easy to read, both from up close and afar, while also providing a sense of movement. After the first iteration, I felt that the company name was not impactful enough in relation to the image as a whole, so scaled it up in the next version. Additionally, I added some more shapes and lines to give the association of the globe and movement to convey what the company does.<br><br>
3. An example of how I made a choice related to comparing one thing to another:<br>
    In Photoshopping two movie posters from different genres, we chose to combine a poster for a comedy with one for a crime series. I think that these two genres appear very different, but that they share a lot of similarities in structure and boldness. This makes it not too challenging to reimagine one in the context of another. I played with expectations for Step Brothers to turn it into The Jinx Brothers. I thought this was interesting because by only altering a couple aspects, a comedy could quickly be flipped to be perceived in a much darker light. Aside from execution issues, I think that this comparison was successful. I was intrigued by the juxtaposition, so I continued this exploration and did the reverse of this, where I turned the drama/thriller It into a comedy by simply changing the name to Lit and changing the figure to a distinctive one from The Hangover.<br><br>
4. An example of something that frustrated me or took a larger amount of time than I would have liked:<br>
I found the soundscape assignment to be very frustrating. I think a lot of this was a personal challenge because I know how to use more complex audio software, and not being able to just alter it very quickly and with more precision, but instead using Audacity, felt limiting to me. I think that because of this, there was not only the learning curve of getting to know Audacity, but also a curve of having to unlearn all the hot keys that I already knew for the other software and find these commands in a different location. I was able to overcome this obstacle by recognizing that I had to let go of my initial expectations and be open to learning something new. In doing so, I had to focus more on the specific content that I was using, rather than hiding behind the automation and effects that I was intending, which helped me to be more deliberate.<br><br>
5. An example of something I am particularly proud of:<br>
    I am particularly proud of the spoof Craigslist advertisement that we completed early on in the semester. Studying psychology and studio arts, I have to both write a lot and push my creativity, but I never have the opportunity to utilize these skills in tandem. This was the first time I’ve been able to complete any creative writing in a long time, and I enjoyed it because it was not a daunting assignment. This stands out to me because I spent time researching used car advertisements and making slight tweaks to my work, and I was mainly surprised with how effective this was able to be with such a simplistic idea and content because of the genre implications. I think that this work set a good tone that I was able to follow throughout the semester. This was successful in that it achieved the goal without being too verbose by playing off expectations, and I would like to continue this in future work.
