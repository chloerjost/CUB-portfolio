  <h3><Design Vision</h3>
  <p>Since working with my initial design vision, I have realized that the specific parallax functionality I have described is unrealistic given my skills and the timeframe for this assignment. Because of this, I have decided to stick with my general design concept but rework how I would like the website to appear and operate. I want to achieve a feeling of simple, laid-back fun. To do this I will focus on color, pattern, and organization.<br> Color:<br> My color scheme is inspired by design from Miami’s South Beach. The colors there include many tropical pastels that are derivatives of the beachy surroundings, mixed with some more vibrant accents. I will utilize these almost-clashing, breezy combinations to create a sense of fun and play. Specifically, I plan to include shades of teal, millennial pink, gray, pale yellow, pale blue, and mango.<br> Pattern:<br> I want to incorporate 80s-inspired patterns, with graphic triangles, zig-zags, bars, and squiggles. Something that I have noticed from researching these is that they rely on small scale and repetition. I think that focusing on these features will help me to keep the website clean while still alluding to the energetic throwback feel that has become associated with these patterns.<br> Organization:<br> I am interested in a layout where elements are horizontally centered with a significant amount of margin at the top. When there are blocks of text as the main content, such as the homepage menu or the About section, I would like these to still be horizontally centered but for the text to be aligned left. I think that using the box model will help me to fully understand how to code this. I want the home page to be a different layout from all the other pages, with a different menu format and margins, to create a sense of interest when users enter the site. In sections with more content, either in number or in length, I would like to set up thumbnails that can be clicked to bring up the content while graying out the rest of the content. I think this will help give the website a fun navigational feature while still keeping it very clean. I am not sure what the images of these thumbnails will be, but I am not necessarily against them being completely random…<br> Rhetorical Analysis:<br> The main purpose of this website for me is to provide a workspace in which I can freely experiment with HTML/CSS and learn how to manipulate it to do exactly what I want from a design standpoint. However, I am sure this purpose applies to only me, and not my audience. While my audience is most likely going to be the people in this class, I still want this website to be representative of my personality (fun but still organized, with a little bit of surprise). The conversational voice is something that is important for me to convey, so that if someone from a small design firm with a laid-back office culture (job aspiration) was to look at this, it would seem like a clear fit.</p>
