<h2>About Me</h2>
<p>Chloe is a senior at the University of Pittsburgh studying Psychology and Studio Arts. She believes that academics, creativity, and humor donâ€™t have to be mutually exclusive, and she aims to prove this every day (time permitting).
Chloe is passionate about art, music, reading, and so much more. One day she hopes to travel the country with her dog. For now, she just hopes for world peace.</p>
