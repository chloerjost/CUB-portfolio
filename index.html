<h2>About Me</h2>
<p>Hey there! My name is Chloe Reshetar-Jost and I am a senior at the University of Pittsburgh. I study Psychology and Studio Arts, which I love because this combination allows me to be both analytical and creative. I first approached video making through a course that covered sound editing, stop motion, and 2D animation. I have since fallen in love with video, and slowly I am learning computer music production, which is equally as exciting. Clearly, I love art (museums, making, you name it), but I also love travel, fashion, and running. I am constantly looking for ways to combine my interests, and I hope to one day fall into something that utilizes these strengths and continues to challenge me.</p>
