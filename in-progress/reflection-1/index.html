  <h3>First Reflection</h3>
  <p>When I began working on this website I knew exactly the feeling I wanted it to evoke: simple, laid-back fun. I wanted to use specific navigational features to convey a sense of ease, with parallax design gently guiding the user between topics while the different menu items floated along the sidebar navigation with every scroll. Unfortunately, I did not realize just how complex this idea would be to code. Because I had never touched HTML/CSS before, I decided to rework the layout and features, while still focusing on the overall design feel.<br><br> To achieve my overall design concept, there were a few elements and inspirations that I knew I wanted to utilize. A sans-serif font would keep it simple and unornamented, so I chose to go with Helvetica for the whole website. My color scheme was inspired by Miami design and culture, including shades of teal, millennial pink, gray, pale yellow, pale blue, and mango (some of these have yet to come). I also wanted to incorporate 80s-inspired patterns, with tic-tac shapes, triangles, and squiggles, to keep it clean but also allude to the free, throwback, energetic nature that has become associated with these patterns in pop culture.<br><br> I approached this assignment with a clear goal in terms of both layout/navigation and general design concept. Being unfamiliar with this medium, however, I knew I had to keep an open mind and not be afraid of redirecting my efforts, even if I had invested a lot of time. This approach has been helping me throughout the semester, on writing assignments, conceptualization, and the actual execution of the code for this website. Similarly, I have been approaching other assignments with the same fun-but-straightforward mentality.<br><br> I have been using this assignment as a way for me to experiment and figure out the different ways that I can manipulate CSS to make it do what I really want from a design standpoint. I created a couple repositories so that I could experiment between the two without completely losing all my progress, but once I settled on the navigational flow, I refocused all my energy into the one. I have more or less been using guess and check as my revision strategy, sourcing the suggestions from websites such as stack overflow. Because of this, there has been a lot of work that I have needed to scrap. I am hoping that as the semester continues and I begin to understand HTML/CSS more thoroughly I will be able to develop a more efficient revision strategy.<br><br> Moving forward I would like to really push this direction. Because I am just finally getting the layout worked out, I would like to emphasize the design choices as we continue to work. I have not included any background images yet because I want to animate some of the 80s-inspired patterns and use those, which will especially boost the interest of the homepage. I am aiming to center the content on each page that is not the home and utilize thumbnails in order to consolidate the information and avoid massive walls of text. I am not yet sure of what these thumbnail images will be, but I would like for them to be more illustrative than exact. I am hoping that once I add these elements I will be able to achieve my design concept, because at the moment I am worried that it all feels very bland.<br> While I do not intend to focus on sound for the upcoming skills assignment, I do think it would be fun to incorporate some form of sound into this website. I am learning how to make electronic music, which could be interesting to either play on different pages, provide the option of playing, or to use as sound effects when different elements are selected throughout the website.<br><br> There has definitely been a lot that I have been struggling with throughout the course of this assignment. Getting the elements to behave as I want, in terms of alignment and other appearance properties, often feels like a battle. Much of my design vision still relies on layout, so completely understanding this is something that I have been working to master. I want to move on to more advanced functions, but I am having a hard time tackling the basics. With the rest of the semester and the more focused skills assignment, I would like to address the following higher-level competencies...<br> 1. Use CSS to reliably center content<br> 2. Create a webpage that is responsive to different sized screens<br> 3. Use thumbnail images to organize and expand into further content<br> 4. Play with opacity in bars behind text</p>
