  <h3>Second Reflection</h3>
  <p>Since the first submission of my work, I have focused a lot on the specific design elements that I wanted to incorporate in the website. I wanted to stick to my initial vision for the website: simple, laid-back fun. Staying true to the color scheme I had initially conceived, I have worked on refining the tones inspired by Miami design and culture, including primarily teals, pinks, peaches, and yellows. Once I had these basic ideas set in stone, I was able to dive more into the layout.<br><br>
	The first significant design piece that I worked on incorporating was the animation on the homepage. For any patterns I used, I wanted them to be reminiscent of classic 80s patterns, so I was sure to make this the first main visual element when anybody navigated to my Github page. Because it did not seem time efficient to try to figure out how to code this when I already knew a more efficient method, I chose to do a simple animation of shapes in Adobe After Effects and use this as a full screen video background. The most frustrating part of this process of uploading it from an external program was that tweaking the colors and the position of the shapes required a separate export and upload for each minor change.<br><br>
	After I got this key animation set up, my next challenge was the layout. Because I had done a lot of guessing and checking in both the HTML and the CSS codes, there were a lot of artifacts from this that did not make sense. This has definitely made the process of developing a layout a lot more difficult. Even with office hours, I have still had a difficult time understanding what the different HTML elements do, and how certain properties affect them. I know that I want the heading to be approximately a third of the way down the page and that I want everything on the website to be centered. I have struggled with getting all the content centered on the page and to not have it weirdly overlap when the page gets resized. In my code, I have also had a hard time keeping track of the different lists because the style for the main menu on the homepage is different than the menu on any of the other pages, which is different than the lists that include the images that I have used to link to my content.<br><br>
	I am happy with how the images from Photoshop that link to any of the content have turned out. I wanted them to be just these simple abstracted images that are not indicative of what they lead to, and I think I have achieved that. However, to make my website more cohesive as a whole, I think I could incorporate some more of the 80s-inspired patterns that reference my homepage background.<br><br> 
	Moving forward, I will continue to work with the width, auto margin, and centered text alignment that we discussed in office hours. I understand these principles conceptually, and now I just have to put them into action. Furthermore, I need to work on the vl and vh properties. I know a lot of it is trial and error, but this has been difficult for me because of my lack of being able to follow my own organization. Perhaps it would be most beneficial for me to completely overhaul my code once and really focus on the organization, and then begin to work on the layout from there.<br><br>
	Entering this class, I was excited because I had some level of proficiency with audio editing and Photoshop. This level of comfort has definitely helped me because I have felt more confident going into the assignments. Additionally, this has allowed me to push myself further and be more experimental with the assignments. For the classwork revision, I chose to redo the movie posters combining two different genres. In class, we combined The Jinx and Step Brothers to create The Jinx Brothers. Revising this, while I felt that perhaps the execution could have been improved a little, I did not feel that there was really much more room to push this creatively. So instead, I chose to combine another thriller movie (It) with another comedy movie (The Hangover), and work on a more seamless execution of this.<br><br>
I have definitely approached all of the assignments with more of a longitudinal approach, knowing that it would be beneficial to be open to changing my ideas as I progressed. This is not how I typically approach assignments, so I have enjoyed this process and the flexibility. I think that working this way has also helped reduce the amount of stress associated with the assignments because I have not been cramming to do them right before they are due, so I have been able to try more new things and be more playful in my approaches. I feel that being less stressed has also helped me to have more fun with the actual content, and I have been able to incorporate humor in ways that I previously have not been able to. Moving forward, both in this course and in life, I definitely will continue to incorporate these strategies.
