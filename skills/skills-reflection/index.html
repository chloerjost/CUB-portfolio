  <h3>Reflection</h3>
  <p>With this skills assignment, I wanted to focus on gaining proficiency in the Audacity program. Although I had prior experience using other DAWs such as Logic Pro X, I had never opened Audacity before. It seemed like a program that would be beneficial to learn now so that I am able to continue to use it beyond college when I no longer have access to Logic. My initial concept was to use Audacity in a more experimental way, instead of the more traditional podcast-oriented manner for which I am pretty sure it was designed. Weird experimental music is something that I’ve been focusing a lot on recently, so I wanted to work to push myself further with a new format. I intended to record a bunch of sounds from the real world, abstract them, and manipulate them within the program to create a series of four musical pieces. However, this did not work out as I planned.<br>
	I spent a lot of time watching Lynda tutorials to simply familiarize myself with the program and some of its hotkeys. I found this to be very beneficial because it was able to go much more in depth than we were in class, simply because there was no time limit here. Since I found these helpful, I continued to go more in depth and watch sections of other Lynda tutorials on more complex topics, including audio mastering techniques, specific dialog editing, and compression. This is the first place that I think I went wrong. These videos were very informative but I found there to be little application of them within the basic level of work that I ended up performing, and watching these videos before I even began to create my pieces even further removed them from how I conceptualized and arranged my project. Since they are kind of the toppings to the musical sundae, I think that if I had watched the videos right as I was done with the basic arrangement, they would have been more effective because the information would be fresh in my mind and I would have been more tuned in to the specific elements that I should be listening for to adjust.<br>
	After watching a lot of videos, I figured that I had done enough studying and that it was time to just jump into the project and begin applying what I had learned. So, I quickly refreshed myself on how to use a Zoom audio recorder and set out into the world to begin to capture some audio samples. I got a wide variety of sounds, from cars driving by to wind chimes to a fan blowing, and I was happy with the selection that I curated. I figured that with the effects that you can apply and manipulate on audio clips, along with the sound generators that Audacity offers, I could heavily alter the collection that I had and produce some pretty weird and fun content.<br>
Unfortunately, what I had envisioned was a lot more complicated to do in Audacity than I had anticipated. It turns out that with the tone generator, you are not able to create a series of different tones to play like a melody or like chords, but rather you have to create a separate tone track for each musical note. To make it even more complicated, the tones are not generated based on their common names (C, F#, etc.), but rather based on their frequencies. Luckily, I have a little music theory knowledge so I was able to figure it out, but all of this definitely made the process way more complicated than I was anticipating.
When we were told that maybe one experimental piece would be fine but that it would be most beneficial to focus on topics such as enhancing the recording quality of audio, I was stubborn and determined to produce something that I (thought) I was comfortable with. However, it quickly became clear to me why this was a recommendation, and I definitely learned a lesson from this.<br>
But, unwilling to give up, I continued on. Although I decided to stick with this experimental route, I definitely had to compromise since my time and my sanity are both very real factors that I have to juggle. At the beginning, I had this idea of abstract storytelling through sound, and with four different pieces I wanted to guide the listener through a year by creating a piece for each season. But when I realized this was going to be unrealistic, I had to switch my ideas a bit. Playing with the sounds that I had and what I was able to do in audacity, I soon found that one of them was a bit brighter, and one was a bit more hollow and somber, and I decided to push these contrasting yet complimentary pieces.<br>
From this skills project, I learned a lot about Audacity… mainly that it’s not great for raw generation but that it is great for audio editing. While I definitely struggled and worked in an inefficient manner, there’s a lesson to be learned here, and I’m happy with the persistence that I had because it led me to a product that I am happy with.
