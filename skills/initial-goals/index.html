  <h3>Initial Goals</h3>
  <p>I would like to focus on sound editing and production. I have some experience with electronic and computer music production using Logic Pro X, but I would like to use this opportunity to focus on audio recording with a more pared-down and accessible program (Audacity).<br><br>
I will begin with watching the Lynda tutorial “Learning Audacity” since I have never used the program before. This includes areas such as:<br>
Adjusting volume automatically, Removing unwanted background noise, Applying compression (2 hours)<br><br>
In terms of production, I want to learn:<br>
1. (0.5 hours): Recording production-quality audio<br>
2. (1 hour): Creating tracks with variety<br>
3. (1 hour): Sounds foley effects<br>
4. (2 hours): Tricks to make separate pieces feel cohesive<br>
5. (2 hours): Mastering an “album”<br><br>
I would like to learn more about how to fully utilize effects such as:<br>
Reverb, EQ (low pass filters, high pass filters, notch filters), Compression (2 hours)<br><br>
Because a lot of this will begin to make sense through application, I plan to spend a majority of my time creating work and utilizing these skills within the program. I would like to create a series of at least 4 musical pieces that experiment with audio that I record and process within Audacity. I am interested in the idea of abstract storytelling through sound. I am sure that creating these pieces will require at least 10 hours.</p>
