<h2>Skills Assignment</h2>
  <h3>Initial Goals</h3>
<p>I would like to focus on sound editing and production. I have some experience with electronic and computer music production using Logic Pro X, but I would like to use this opportunity to focus on audio recording with a more pared-down and accessible program (Audacity).<br>
I will begin with watching the Lynda tutorial “Learning Audacity” since I have never used the program before. This includes areas such as:<br>
Adjusting volume automatically<br>
Removing unwanted background noise<br>
Applying compression<br>
(2 hours)<br>
In terms of production, I want to learn:<br>
Recording production-quality audio (0.5 hours)<br>
Creating tracks with variety (1 hour)<br>
Sounds foley effects (1 hour)<br>
Tricks to make separate pieces feel cohesive (2 hours)<br>
    Mastering an “album” (2 hours)<br>
I would like to learn more about how to fully utilize effects such as:<br>
Reverb<br>
EQ (low pass filters, high pass filters, notch filters)<br>
Compression<br>
  (2 hours)<br>
Because a lot of this will begin to make sense through application, I plan to spend a majority of my time creating work and utilizing these skills within the program. I would like to create a series of at least 4 musical pieces that experiment with audio that I record and process within Audacity. I am interested in the idea of abstract storytelling through sound. I am sure that creating these pieces will require at least 10 hours.</p>

            <tr><td>02.21 1pm</td><td>02.21 3pm</td><td>Learning Audacity Lynda Tutorial</td><td>This video was really helpful. Even though I already knew a lot of what the basic functionality did, I had no idea how to work this in Audacity. It provided a lot of the hot keys that I am sure will be very helpful once I begin to use the program.</td></tr>
            <tr><td>02.22 9am</td><td>02.22 10am</td><td>3 Foley Technique tutorials</td><td>While these videos were very interesting, I am not sure of how much use they will be to me. However, they did help me to think about sound in a more creative way, so that is something that I am excited to explore.</td></tr>
            <tr><td>02.22 6pm</td><td>02.22 9pm</td><td>Audio Mastering Techninques Lynda Tutorial</td><td>This video provided a lot more complex technical information than the others. I had to pause and replay this one a lot more, but I'm hoping that once I begin the mastering process it will make more sense in practicality.</td></tr>
            <tr><td>02.25 12pm</td><td>02.25 12:30pm</td><td>EQ, Compression, Reverb, Delay section of Lynda Tutorial</td><td>Although this tutorial was on how to use these effects in Logic, I think they will have a similar application in Audacity.</td></tr>
            <tr><td>02.25 12:30pm</td><td>02.25 1:30pm</td><td>Editing the Dialog Clips section of Lynda Tutorial</td><td>A lot of these processes that I learned were similar to those explained but the initial Lynda tutorial, but the reinforcement is always helpful.</td></tr>
            <tr><td>02.27 5:00pm</td><td>02.27 5:30pm</td><td>Using Zoom Recorder</td><td>This is the primary method that I intend to use to record audio because I have access to one and I know it produces high quality material. It had been a while since I had used one, so I am glad that I was able to take this time to re-acquaint myself. I am excited to begin actually recording.</td></tr>
