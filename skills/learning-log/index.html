            <tr><td>02.21 1pm</td><td>02.21 3pm</td><td>Learning Audacity Lynda Tutorial</td><td>This video was really helpful. Even though I already knew a lot of what the basic functionality did, I had no idea how to work this in Audacity. It provided a lot of the hot keys that I am sure will be very helpful once I begin to use the program.</td></tr>
            <tr><td>02.22 9am</td><td>02.22 10am</td><td>3 Foley Technique tutorials</td><td>While these videos were very interesting, I am not sure of how much use they will be to me. However, they did help me to think about sound in a more creative way, so that is something that I am excited to explore.</td></tr>
            <tr><td>02.22 6pm</td><td>02.22 9pm</td><td>Audio Mastering Techninques Lynda Tutorial</td><td>This video provided a lot more complex technical information than the others. I had to pause and replay this one a lot more, but I'm hoping that once I begin the mastering process it will make more sense in practicality.</td></tr>
            <tr><td>02.25 12pm</td><td>02.25 12:30pm</td><td>EQ, Compression, Reverb, Delay section of Lynda Tutorial</td><td>Although this tutorial was on how to use these effects in Logic, I think they will have a similar application in Audacity.</td></tr>
            <tr><td>02.25 12:30pm</td><td>02.25 1:30pm</td><td>Editing the Dialog Clips section of Lynda Tutorial</td><td>A lot of these processes that I learned were similar to those explained but the initial Lynda tutorial, but the reinforcement is always helpful.</td></tr>
            <tr><td>02.27 5pm</td><td>02.27 5:30pm</td><td>Using Zoom Recorder</td><td>This is the primary method that I intend to use to record audio because I have access to one and I know it produces high quality material. It had been a while since I had used one, so I am glad that I was able to take this time to re-acquaint myself. I am excited to begin actually recording.</td></tr>
            <tr><td>02.28 8am</td><td>02.28 10am</td><td>Recording Sounds</td><td>Today I began recording sounds that I found in the real world. I plan on using these both as room sounds, and to manipulate them to be the melodies in the forefront of my pieces. I think that with the sound generators and the effects that Audacity offers I will be able to use these to produce some cool content.</td></tr>
            <tr><td>03.02 4pm</td><td>03.02 7:30pm</td><td>Editing in Audacity</td><td>So far with basic audio editing I am happy with what I have but it is taking me a lot longer than I anticipated, and I think that part of this is because I am so used to the hot keys and functions of a different DAW.</td></tr>
            <tr><td>03.05 8am</td><td>03.05 10:30am</td><td>Editing in Audacity</td><td>Today I further engaged with what I was working on the other day. I tried to generate musical notes but it was incredibly difficult and illogical.</td></tr>
            <tr><td>03.05 3pm</td><td>03.05 4pm</td><td>Editing in Audacity</td><td>I contined to work on what I had going but I am frustrated and need to reevaluate my plans for this project.</td></tr>
            <tr><td>03.06 12pm</td><td>03.06 2:30pm</td><td>Editing in Audacity</td><td>After totally revising my plan, I feel I have made decent progress with the combination of generated tones and manipulation of recorded audio.</td></tr>
            <tr><td>03.07 11am</td><td>03.07 1pm</td><td>Editing and Mastering Track in Audacity</td><td>Finally at a point where I feel okay/happy with the content that I've created, and I was happy that I was able to master the track.</td></tr>
